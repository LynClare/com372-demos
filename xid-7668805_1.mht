      <P>1. The mission of Christ the Redeemer, which is entrusted to =
the=20
      Church, is still very far from completion. As the second =
millennium after=20
      Christ's coming draws to an end, an overall view of the human race =
shows=20
      that this mission is still only beginning and that we must commit=20
      ourselves wholeheartedly to its service. It is the Spirit who =
impels us to=20
      proclaim the great works of God: "For if I preach the Gospel, that =
gives=20
      me no ground for boasting. For necessity is laid upon me. Woe to =
me if I=20
      do not preach the Gospel!" (1 Cor 9: 16)</P>
      <P>In the name of the whole Church, I sense an urgent duty to =
repeat this=20
      cry of St. Paul. From the beginning of my Pontificate I have =
chosen to=20
      travel to the ends of the earth in order to show this missionary =
concern.=20
      My direct contact with peoples who do not know Christ has =
convinced me=20
      even more of the <I>urgency of missionary activity</I>, a subject =
to which=20
      I am devoting the present encyclical.</P>
      <P>The Second Vatican Council sought to renew the Church's life =
and=20
      activity in the light of the needs of the contemporary world. The =
Council=20
      emphasized the Church's "missionary nature," basing it in a =
dynamic way on=20
      the Trinitarian mission itself. The missionary thrust therefore =
belongs to=20
      the very nature of the Christian life, and is also the inspiration =
behind=20
      ecumenism: "that they may all be one...so that the world may =
believe that=20
      you have sent me" (Jn 17:21).</P>
      <P>2. The Council has already borne much fruit in the realm of =
missionary=20
      activity. There has been an increase of local churches with their =
own=20
      bishops, clergy and workers in the apostolate. The presence of =
Christian=20
      communities is more evident in the life of nations, and communion =
between=20
      the churches has led to a lively exchange of spiritual benefits =
and gifts.=20
      The commitment of the laity to the work of evangelization is =
changing=20
      ecclesial life, while particular churches are more willing to meet =
with=20
      the members of other Christian churches and other religions, and =
to enter=20
      into dialogue and cooperation with them. Above all, there is a new =

      awareness that<I> missionary activity is a matter for all =
Christians</I>,=20
      for all dioceses and parishes, Church institutions and =
associations.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, in this "new springtime" of Christianity there is =
an=20
      undeniable negative tendency, and the present document is meant to =
help=20
      overcome it. Missionary activity specifically directed "to the =
nations"=20
      (<I>ad gentes</I>) appears to be waning, and this tendency is =
certainly=20
      not in line with the directives of the Council and of subsequent=20
      statements of the Magisterium. Difficulties both internal and =
external=20
      have weakened the Church's missionary thrust toward =
non-Christians, a fact=20
      which must arouse concern among all who believe in Christ. For in =
the=20
      Church's history, missionary drive has always been a sign of =
vitality,=20
      just as its lessening is a sign of a crisis of faith.<FONT =

      <P>Twenty-five years after the conclusion of the Council and the=20

      name=3D-2>2</A></SUP></FONT> I wish to invite the Church to =
<I>renew her=20
      missionary commitment</I>. The present document has as its goal an =

      interior renewal of faith and Christian life. For missionary =
activity=20
      renews the Church, revitalizes faith and Christian identity, and =
offers=20
      fresh enthusiasm and new incentive. <I>Faith is strengthened when =
it is=20
      given to others!</I> It is in commitment to the Church's universal =
mission=20
      that the new evangelization of Christian peoples will find =
inspiration and=20
      support.</P>
      <P>But what moves me even more strongly to proclaim the urgency of =

      missionary evangelization is the fact that it is the primary =
service which=20
      the Church can render to every individual and to all humanity in =
the=20
      modern world, a world which has experienced marvelous achievements =
but=20
      which seems to have lost its sense of ultimate realities and of =
existence=20
      itself. "Christ the Redeemer," I wrote in my first encyclical, =
"fully=20
      reveals man to himself.... The person who wishes to understand =
himself=20
      thoroughly...must...draw near to Christ.... [The] Redemption that =
took=20
      place through the cross has definitively restored to man his =
dignity and=20
      given back meaning to his life in the world."<FONT size=3D2=20

      name=3D-3>3</A></SUP></FONT></P>
      <P>I also have other reasons and aims: to respond to the many =
requests for=20
      a document of this kind; to clear up doubts and ambiguities =
regarding=20
      missionary activity <I>ad gentes</I>, and to confirm in their =
commitment=20
      those exemplary brothers and sisters dedicated to missionary =
activity and=20
      all those who assist them; to foster missionary vocations; to =
encourage=20
      theologians to explore and expound systematically the various =
aspects of=20
      missionary activity; to give a fresh impulse to missionary =
activity by=20
      fostering the commitment of the particular churches - especially =
those of=20
      recent origin - to send forth and receive missionaries; and to =
assure=20
      non-Christians and particularly the authorities of countries to =
which=20
      missionary activity is being directed that all of this has but one =

      purpose: to serve man by revealing to him the love of God made =
manifest in=20
      Jesus Christ.</P>
      <P>3. <I>Peoples everywhere, open the doors to Christ!</I> His =
Gospel in=20
      no way detracts from man's freedom, from the respect that is owed =
to every=20
      culture and to whatever is good in each religion. By accepting =
Christ, you=20
      open yourselves to the definitive Word of God, to the One in whom =
God has=20
      made himself fully known and has shown us the path to himself.</P>
      <P>The number of those who do not know Christ and do not belong to =
the=20
      Church is constantly on the increase. Indeed, since the end of the =
Council=20
      it has almost doubled. When we consider this immense portion of =
humanity=20
      which is loved by the Father and for whom he sent his Son, the =
urgency of=20
      the Church's mission is obvious.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, our own times offer the Church new =
opportunities in=20
      this field: we have witnessed the collapse of oppressive =
ideologies and=20
      political systems; the opening of frontiers and the formation of a =
more=20
      united world due to an increase in communications; the affirmation =
among=20
      peoples of the gospel values which Jesus made incarnate in his own =
life=20
      (peace, justice, brotherhood, concern for the needy); and a kind =
of=20
      soulless economic and technical development which only stimulates =
the=20
      search for the truth about God, about man and about the meaning of =
life=20
      itself.</P>
      <P>God is opening before the Church the horizons of a humanity =
more fully=20
      prepared for the sowing of the Gospel. I sense that the moment has =
come to=20
      commit all of the Church's energies to a new evangelization and to =
the=20
      mission <I>ad gentes</I>. No believer in Christ, no institution of =
the=20
      Church can avoid this supreme duty: to proclaim Christ to all =
peoples.</P>

      can be understood and only in faith that it finds its basis.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, also as a result of the changes which have taken =
place in=20
      modern times and the spread of new theological ideas, some people =
wonder:=20
      <I>Is missionary work among non-Christians still relevant?</I> Has =
it not=20
      been replaced by inter-religious dialogue? Is not human =
development an=20

conscience and=20
      for freedom exclude all efforts at conversion? Is it not possible =
to=20
      attain salvation in any religion? Why then should there be =
missionary=20
      activity?</P>
      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>"No one comes to the Father, but by me"</I></B> (Jn =
14:6)</P>
      <P>5. If we go back to the beginnings of the Church, we find a =
clear=20
      affirmation that Christ is the one Savior of all, the only one =
able to=20
      reveal God and lead to God. In reply to the Jewish religious =
authorities=20
      who question the apostles about the healing of the lame man, Peter =
says:=20
      "By the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified, whom =
God=20
      raised from the dead, by him this man is standing before you =
well.... And=20
      there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name =
under heaven=20
      given among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:10, 12). This=20
      statement, which was made to the Sanhedrin, has a universal value, =
since=20
      for all people-Jews and Gentiles alike - salvation can only come =
from=20
      Jesus Christ.</P>
      <P>The universality of this salvation in Christ is asserted =
throughout the=20
      New Testament. St. Paul acknowledges the risen Christ as the Lord. =
He=20
      writes: "Although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on =
earth - as=20
      indeed there are many 'gods' and many 'lords' - yet for us there =
is one=20
      God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, =
and one=20
      Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom =
we exist"=20
      (1 Cor 8:5-6). One God and one Lord are asserted by way of =
contrast to the=20
      multitude of "gods" and "lords" commonly accepted. Paul reacts =
against the=20
      polytheism of the religious environment of his time and emphasizes =
what is=20
      characteristic of the Christian faith: belief in one God and in =
one Lord=20
      sent by God.</P>
      <P>In the Gospel of St. John, this salvific universality of Christ =

      embraces all the aspects of his mission of grace, truth and =
revelation:=20
      the Word is "the true light that enlightens every man" (Jn 1:9). =
And=20
      again, "no one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the =
bosom of the=20
      Father, he has made him known" (Jn 1:18; cf. Mt 11:27). God's =
revelation=20
      becomes definitive and complete through his only-begotten Son: "In =
many=20
      and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets; =
but in=20
      these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed =
the heir=20
      of all things, through whom he also created the world" (Heb 1:1-2; =
cf. Jn=20
      14:6). In this definitive Word of his revelation, God has made =
himself=20
      known in the fullest possible way. He has revealed to mankind =
<I>who he=20
      is</I>. This definitive self-revelation of God is the fundamental =
reason=20
      why the Church is missionary by her very nature. She cannot do =
other than=20
      proclaim the Gospel, that is, the fullness of the truth which God =
has=20
      enabled us to know about himself.</P>
      <P>Christ is the one mediator between God and mankind: "For there =
is one=20
      God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ =
Jesus,=20
      who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony to which was =
borne at=20
      the proper time. For this I was appointed a preacher and apostle =
(I am=20
      telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in =
faith and=20
      truth" (1 Tm 2:5-7; cf. Heb 4:14-16). No one, therefore, can enter =
into=20
      communion with God except through Christ, by the working of the =
Holy=20
      Spirit. Christ's one, universal mediation, far from being an =
obstacle on=20
      the journey toward God, is the way established by God himself, a =
fact of=20
      which Christ is fully aware. Although participated forms of =
mediation of=20
      different kinds and degrees are not excluded, they acquire meaning =
and=20
      value <I>only</I> from Christ's own mediation, and they cannot be=20
      understood as parallel or complementary to his.</P>
      <P>6. To introduce any sort of separation between the Word and =
Jesus=20
      Christ is contrary to the Christian faith. St. John clearly states =
that=20
      the Word, who "was in the beginning with God," is the very one who =
"became=20
      flesh" (Jn 1:2, 14). Jesus is the Incarnate Word-a single and =
indivisible=20
      person. One cannot separate Jesus from the Christ or speak of a =
"Jesus of=20
      history" who would differ from the "Christ of faith." The Church=20
      acknowledges and confesses Jesus as "the Christ, the Son of the =
living=20
      God" (Mt 16:16): Christ is none other than Jesus of Nazareth: he =
is the=20
      Word of God made man for the salvation of all. In Christ "the =
whole=20
      fullness of deity dwells bodily" (Col 2:9) and "from his fullness =
have we=20
      all received" (Jn 1:16). The "only Son, who is the bosom of the =
Father"=20
      (Jn 1:18) is "the beloved Son, in whom we have redemption.... For =
in him=20
      all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to =
reconcile=20
      to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace =
by the=20
      blood of his Cross" (Col 1:13-14, 19-20). It is precisely this =
uniqueness=20
      of Christ which gives him an absolute and universal significance, =
whereby,=20

      help us to understand the <I>one mystery of salvation</I>, so that =

      <P>10. The universality of salvation means that it is granted not =
only to=20
      those who explicitly believe in Christ and have entered the =
Church. Since=20
      salvation is offered to all, it must be made concretely available =
to all.=20
      But it is clear that today, as in the past, many people do not =
have an=20
      opportunity to come to know or accept the gospel revelation or to =
enter=20
      the Church. The social and cultural conditions in which they live =
do not=20
      permit this, and frequently they have been brought up in other =
religious=20
      traditions. For such people salvation in Christ is accessible by =
virtue of=20
      a grace which, while having a mysterious relationship to the =
Church, does=20
      not make them formally part of the Church but enlightens them in a =
way=20
      which is accommodated to their spiritual and material situation. =
This=20
      grace comes from Christ; it is the result of his Sacrifice and is=20
      communicated by the Holy Spirit. It enables each person to attain=20
      salvation through his or her free cooperation.</P>
      <P>For this reason the Council, after affirming the centrality of =
the=20
      Paschal Mystery, went on to declare that "this applies not only to =

      Christians but to all people of good will in whose hearts grace is =

      secretly at work. Since Christ died for everyone, and since the =
ultimate=20
      calling of each of us comes from God and is therefore a universal =
one, we=20

      regarding the mission <I>ad gentes</I>? While respecting the =
beliefs and=20
      sensitivities of all, we must first clearly affirm our faith in =
Christ,=20
      the one Savior of mankind, a faith we have received as a gift from =
on=20
      high, not as a result of any merit of our own. We say with Paul, =
"I am not=20
      ashamed of the Gospel: it is the power of God for salvation to =
everyone=20
      who has faith" (Rom 1:16). Christian martyrs of all times - =
including our=20
      own - have given and continue to give their lives in order to bear =
witness=20
      to this faith, in the conviction that every human being needs =
Jesus=20
      Christ, who has conquered sin and death and reconciled mankind to =
God.</P>
      <P>Confirming his words by miracles and by his resurrection from =
the dead,=20
      Christ proclaimed himself to be the Son of God dwelling in =
intimate union=20
      with the Father, and was recognized as such by his disciples. The =
Church=20
      offers mankind the Gospel, that prophetic message which responds =
to the=20
      needs and aspirations of the human heart and always remains "Good =
News."=20
      The Church cannot fail to proclaim that Jesus came to reveal the =
face of=20
      God and to merit salvation for all humanity by his cross and=20
      resurrection.</P>
      <P>To the question, "<I>why mission?</I>" we reply with the =
Church's faith=20
      and experience that true liberation consists in opening oneself to =
the=20
      love of Christ. In him, and only in him, are we set free from all=20
      alienation and doubt, from slavery to the power of sin and death. =
Christ=20
      is truly "our peace" (Eph 2:14); "the love of Christ impels us" (2 =
Cor=20
      5:14), giving meaning and joy to our life. <I>Mission is an issue =
of=20
      faith</I>, an accurate indicator of our faith in Christ and his =
love for=20
      us.</P>
      <P>The temptation today is to reduce Christianity to merely human =
wisdom,=20
      a pseudo-science of well-being. In our heavily secularized world a =

      "gradual secularization of salvation" has taken place, so that =
people=20
      strive for the good of man, but man who is truncated, reduced to =
his=20
      merely horizontal dimension. We know, however, that Jesus came to =
bring=20
      integral salvation, one which embraces the whole person and all =
mankind,=20
      and opens up the wondrous prospect of divine filiation. <I>Why=20
      mission?</I> Because to us, as to St. Paul, "this grace was given, =
to=20
      preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ" (Eph =
3:8).=20
      Newness of life in him is the "Good News" for men and women of =
every age:=20
      all are called to it and destined for it. Indeed, all people are =
searching=20
      for it, albeit at times in a confused way, and have a right to =
know the=20
      value of this gift and to approach it freely. The Church, and =
every=20
      individual Christian within her, may not keep hidden or monopolize =
this=20
      newness and richness which has been received from God's bounty in =
order to=20
      be communicated to all mankind.</P>
      <P>This is why the Church's mission derives not only from the =
Lord's=20
      mandate but also from the profound demands of God's life within =
us. Those=20
      who are incorporated in the Catholic Church ought to sense their =
privilege=20
      and for that very reason their greater obligation of <I>bearing =
witness to=20
      the faith and to the Christian life</I> as a service to their =
brothers and=20
      sisters and as a fitting response to God. They should be ever =
mindful that=20
      "they owe their distinguished status not to their own merits but =
to=20
      Christ's special grace; and if they fail to respond to this grace =

and=20

of God=20

      brought about by Christ and in Christ, and proclaimed to all =
peoples by=20
      the Church, which works and prays for its perfect and definitive=20
      realization.</P>
      <P>The Old Testament attests that God chose and formed a people =
for=20
      himself, in order to reveal and carry out his loving plan. But at =
the same=20
      time God is the Creator and Father of all people; he cares and =
provides=20
      for them, extending his blessing to all (cf. Gn 12:3); he has =
established=20
      a covenant with all of them (cf. Gn 9:1-17). Israel experiences a =

      and saving God (cf. Dt 4:37; 7:6-8; Is 43:1-7) and becomes his =

Israel comes=20
      to realize that her election has a universal meaning (cf. for =

      <P>13. Jesus of Nazareth brings God's plan to fulfillment. After =
receiving=20
      the Holy Spirit at his Baptism, Jesus makes clear his messianic =
calling:=20
      he goes about Galilee "preaching the Gospel of God and saying: =
'The time=20
      is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and =
believe in the=20
      Gospel'" (Mk 1:14-15; cf. Mt 4:17; Lk 4:43). The proclamation and=20
      establishment of God's kingdom are the purpose of his mission: "I =
was sent=20
      for this purpose" (Lk 4:43). But that is not all. Jesus himself is =
the=20
      "Good News," as he declares at the very beginning of his mission =
in the=20
      synagogue at Nazareth, when he applies to himself the words of =
Isaiah=20
      about the Anointed One sent by the Spirit of the Lord (cf. Lk =
4;14-21).=20
      Since the "Good News" is Christ, there is an identity between the =
message=20
      and the messenger, between saying, doing and being. His power, the =
secret=20
      of the effectiveness of his actions, lies in his total =
identification with=20
      the message he announces; he proclaims the "Good News" not just by =
what he=20
      says or does, but by what he is.</P>
      <P>The ministry of Jesus is described in the context of his =
journeys=20
      within his homeland. Before Easter, the scope of his mission was =
focused=20
      on Israel. Nevertheless, Jesus offers a new element of extreme =
importance.=20
      The eschatological reality is not relegated to a remote "end of =
the=20
      world," but is already close and at work in our midst. The kingdom =
of God=20
      is at hand (cf. Mk 1:15); its coming is to be prayed for (cf. Mt =
6:10);=20
      faith can glimpse it already at work in signs such as miracles =
(cf. Mt=20
      11:4-5) and exorcisms (cf. Mt 12:25-28), in the choosing of the =
Twelve=20
      (cf. Mk 3:13-19), and in the proclamation of the Good News to the =
poor=20
      (cf. Lk 4:18). Jesus' encounters with Gentiles make it clear that =
entry=20
      into the kingdom comes through faith and conversion (cf. Mk 1:15), =
and not=20
      merely by reason of ethnic background.</P>
      <P>The kingdom which Jesus inaugurates is the kingdom of God. =
Jesus=20
      himself reveals who this God is, the One whom he addresses by the =
intimate=20
      term "Abba," Father (cf. Mk 14:36). God, as revealed above all in =
the=20
      parables (cf. Lk 15:3-32; Mt 20:1-16), is sensitive to the needs =
and=20
      sufferings of every human being: he is a Father filled with love =
and=20
      compassion, who grants forgiveness and freely bestows the favors =
asked of=20
      him.</P>
      <P>St. John tells us that "God is love" (1 Jn 4:8, 16). Every =
person=20
      therefore is invited to "repent" and to "believe" in God's =
merciful love.=20
      The kingdom will grow insofar as every person learns to turn to =
God in the=20
      intimacy of prayer as to a Father (cf. Lk 11:2; Mt 23:9) and =
strives to do=20
      his will (cf. Mt 7:21).</P>
      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>Characteristics of the Kingdom and Its =
Demands</I></B></P>
      <P>14. Jesus gradually reveals the characteristics and demands of =
the=20
      kingdom through his words, his actions and his own person.</P>
      <P>The kingdom of God is meant for all mankind, and all people are =
called=20
      to become members of it. To emphasize this fact, Jesus drew =
especially=20
      near to those on the margins of society, and showed them special =
favor in=20
      announcing the Good News. At the beginning of his ministry he =
proclaimed=20
      that he was "anointed...to preach good news to the poor" (Lk =
4:18). To all=20
      who are victims of rejection and contempt Jesus declares: "Blessed =
are you=20
      poor" (Lk 6:20). What is more, he enables such individuals to =
experience=20
      liberation even now, by being close to them, going to eat in their =
homes=20
      (cf. Lk 5:30; 15:2), treating them as equals and friends (cf. Lk =
7:34),=20
      and making them feel loved by God, thus revealing his tender care =
for the=20
      needy and for sinners (cf. Lk 15:1-32).</P>
      <P>The liberation and salvation brought by the kingdom of God come =
to the=20
      human person both in his physical and spiritual dimensions. Two =
gestures=20
      are characteristic of Jesus' mission: healing and forgiving. =
Jesus' many=20
      healings clearly show his great compassion in the face of human =
distress,=20
      but they also signify that in the kingdom there will no longer be =
sickness=20
      or suffering, and that his mission, from the very beginning, is =
meant to=20
      free people from these evils. In Jesus' eyes, healings are also a =
sign of=20
      spiritual salvation, namely liberation from sin. By performing =
acts of=20
      healing, he invites people to faith, conversion and the desire for =

      forgiveness (cf. Lk 5:24). Once there is faith, healing is an=20
      encouragement to go further: it leads to salvation (cf. Lk =
18:42-43). The=20
      acts of liberation from demonic possession-the supreme evil and =
symbol of=20
      sin and rebellion against God-are signs that indeed "the kingdom =
of God=20
      has come upon you" (Mt 12:28).</P>
      <P>15. The kingdom aims at transforming human relationships; it =
grows=20
      gradually as people slowly learn to love, forgive and serve one =
another.=20
      Jesus sums up the whole Law, focusing it on the commandment of =
love (cf.=20
      Mt 22:34-40; Lk 10:25-28). Before leaving his disciples, he gives =
them a=20
      "new commandment": "Love one another; even as I have loved you" =
(Jn 13:34;=20
      cf. 15:12). Jesus' love for the world finds its highest expression =
in the=20
      gift of his life for mankind (cf. Jn 15:13), which manifests the =
love=20
      which the Father has for the world (cf. Jn 3:16). The kingdom's =
nature,=20
      therefore, is one of communion among all human beings-with one =
another and=20
      with God.</P>
      <P>The kingdom is the concern of everyone: individuals, society, =
and the=20
      world. Working for the kingdom means acknowledging and promoting =
God's=20
      activity, which is present in human history and transforms it. =
Building=20
      the kingdom means working for liberation from evil in all its =
forms. In a=20
      word, the kingdom of God is the manifestation and the realization =
of God's=20
      plan of salvation in all its fullness.</P>
      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>In the Risen Christ God's Kingdom Is Fulfilled and=20
      Proclaimed</I></B></P>
      <P>16. By raising Jesus from the dead, God has conquered death, =
and in=20
      Jesus he has definitely inaugurated his kingdom. During his =
earthly life,=20
      Jesus was the Prophet of the kingdom; after his passion, =
resurrection and=20
      ascension into heaven he shares in God's power and in his dominion =
over=20
      the world (cf. Mt 28:18; Acts 2:36; Eph 1:18-21). The resurrection =
gives a=20
      universal scope to Christ's message, his actions and whole =
mission. The=20
      disciples recognize that the kingdom is already present in the =
person of=20
      Jesus and is slowly being established within man and the world =
through a=20
      mysterious connection with him.</P>
      <P>Indeed, after the resurrection, the disciples preach the =
kingdom by=20
      proclaiming Jesus crucified and risen from the dead. In Samaria, =
Philip=20
      "preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus =
Christ"=20
      (Acts 8:12). In Rome, we find Paul "preaching the kingdom of God =
and=20
      teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ'' (Acts 28:31). The first =
Christians=20
      also proclaim "the kingdom of Christ and of God" (Eph 5:5; cf. Rev =
11:15;=20
      12:10), or "the kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ" (2 Pt =
1:11).=20
      The preaching of the early Church was centered on the proclamation =
of=20
      Jesus Christ, with whom the kingdom was identified. Now, as then, =
there is=20
      a need to unite <I>the proclamation of the kingdom of God </I>(the =
content=20
      of Jesus' own "kerygma") and <I>the proclamation of the =
Christ-event</I>=20
      (the "kerygma" of the apostles). The two proclamations are =
complementary;=20
      each throws light on the other.</P>
      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>The Kingdom in Relation to Christ and the =
Church</I></B></P>
      <P>17. Nowadays the kingdom is much spoken of, but not always in a =
way=20
      consonant with the thinking of the Church. In fact, there are =
ideas about=20
      salvation and mission which can be called "anthropocentric" in the =

      reductive sense of the word, inasmuch as they are focused on man's =
earthly=20
      needs. In this view, the kingdom tends to become something =
completely=20
      human and secularized; what counts are programs and struggles for =
a=20
      liberation which is socio-economic, political and even cultural, =
but=20
      within a horizon that is closed to the transcendent. Without =
denying that=20
      on this level too there are values to be promoted, such a notion=20
      nevertheless remains within the confines of a kingdom of man, =
deprived of=20
      its authentic and profound dimensions. Such a view easily =
translates into=20
      one more ideology of purely earthly progress. The kingdom of God, =
however,=20
      "is not of this world...is not from the world" (Jn 18:36).</P>
      <P>There are also conceptions which deliberately emphasize the =
kingdom and=20
      which describe themselves as "kingdom-centered." They stress the =
image of=20
      a Church which is not concerned about herself, but which is =
totally=20
      concerned with bearing witness to and serving the kingdom. It is a =
"Church=20
      for others" just as Christ is the "man for others." The Church's =
task is=20
      described as though it had to proceed in two directions: on the =
one hand=20
      promoting such "values of the kingdom" as peace, justice, freedom, =

      brotherhood, etc,, while on the other hand fostering dialogue =
between=20
      peoples, cultures and religions, so that through a mutual =
enrichment they=20
      might help the world to be renewed and to journey ever closer =
toward the=20
      kingdom.</P>
      <P>Together with positive aspects, these conceptions often reveal =
negative=20
      aspects as well. First, they are silent about Christ: the kingdom =
of which=20
      they speak is "theocentrically" based, since, according to them, =
Christ=20
      cannot be understood by those who lack Christian faith, whereas =
different=20
      peoples, cultures and religions are capable of finding common =
ground in=20
      the one divine reality, by whatever name it is called. For the =
same reason=20
      they put great stress on the mystery of creation, which is =
reflected in=20
      the diversity of cultures and beliefs, but they keep silent about =
the=20
      mystery of redemption. Furthermore, the kingdom, as they =
understand it,=20
      ends up either leaving very little room for the Church or =
undervaluing the=20
      Church in reaction to a presumed "ecclesiocentrism" of the past, =
and=20
      because they consider the Church herself only a sign, for that =
matter a=20
      sign not without ambiguity.</P>
      <P>18. This is not the kingdom of God as we know it from =
Revelation. The=20
      kingdom cannot be detached either from Christ or from the =
Church.</P>
      <P>As has already been said, Christ not only proclaimed the =
kingdom, but=20
      in him the kingdom itself became present and was fulfilled. This =
happened=20
      not only through his words and his deeds: "Above all,...the =
kingdom is=20
      made manifest in the very person of Christ, Son of God and Son of =
Man, who=20
      came 'to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many' (Mk=20

      while remaining distinct from Christ and the kingdom, the Church =

      <P>19. It is within this overall perspective that the reality of =
the=20
      kingdom is understood. Certainly, the kingdom demands the =
promotion of=20
      human values, as well as those which can properly be called =
"evangelical,"=20
      since they are intimately bound up with the "Good News." But this =

      <P>20. The Church is effectively and concretely at the service of =
the=20
      kingdom. This is seen especially in her preaching, which is a call =
to=20
      conversion. Preaching constitutes the Church's first and =
fundamental way=20
      of serving the coming of the kingdom in individuals and in human =
society.=20
      Eschatological salvation begins even now in newness of life in =
Christ: "To=20
      all who believed in him, who believed in his name, he gave power =
to become=20
      children of God" (Jn 1:12).</P>
      <P>The Church, then, serves the kingdom by establishing =
communities and=20
      founding new particular churches, and by guiding them to mature =

open to=20
      the working of the Spirit who breathes when and where he wills =

      <P>22. All the Evangelists, when they describe the risen Christ's =
meeting=20
      with his apostles, conclude with the "missionary mandate": "All =
authority=20
      in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make =

      disciples of all nations,...and lo, I am with you always, to the =
close of=20
      the age" (Mt 28:18-20; cf. Mk 16:15-18; Lk 24:46-49; Jn =
20:21-23).</P>
      <P>This is <I>a sending forth in the Spirit</I>, as is clearly =
apparent in=20
      the Gospel of John: Christ sends his own into the world, just as =
the=20
      Father has sent him, and to this end he gives them the Spirit. =
Luke, for=20
      his part, closely links the witness the apostles are to give to =
Christ=20
      with the working of the Spirit, who will enable them to fulfill =
the=20
      mandate they have received.</P>
      <P>23. The different versions of the "missionary mandate" contain =
common=20
      elements as well as characteristics proper to each. Two elements, =
however,=20
      are found in all the versions. First, there is the universal =
dimension of=20
      the task entrusted to the apostles, who are sent to "all nations" =
(Mt=20
      28:19); "into all the world and...to the whole creation" (Mk =
16:15); to=20
      "all nations" (Lk 24:47); "to the end of the earth" (Acts 1:8). =
Secondly,=20
      there is the assurance given to the apostles by the Lord that they =
will=20
      not be alone in the task, but will receive the strength and the =
means=20
      necessary to carry out their mission. The reference here is to the =

      presence and power of the spirit and the help of Jesus himself: =
"And they=20
      went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with =
them" (Mk=20
      16:20).</P>
      <P>As for the different emphases found in each version, Mark =
presents=20
      mission as proclamation or kerygma: "Preach the Gospel" (Mk =
16:15). His=20
      aim is to lead his readers to repeat Peter's profession of faith: =
"You are=20
      the Christ" (Mk 8:29), and to say with the Roman centurion who =
stood=20
      before the body of Jesus on the cross: "Truly this man was the Son =
of=20
      God!" (Mk 15:39) In Matthew, the missionary emphasis is placed on =
the=20
      foundation of the Church and on her teaching (cf. Mt 28:19-20; =
16:18).=20
      According to him, the mandate shows that the proclamation of the =
Gospel=20
      must be completed by a specific ecclesial and sacramental =
catechesis. In=20
      Luke, mission is presented as witness (cf. Lk 24:48; Acts 1:8), =
centered=20
      especially on the resurrection (cf. Acts 1:22). The missionary is =
invited=20
      to believe in the transforming power of the Gospel and to proclaim =
what=20
      Luke presents so well, that is, conversion to God's love and =
mercy, the=20
      experience of a complete liberation which goes to the root of all =
evil,=20
      namely sin.</P>
      <P>John is the only Evangelist to speak explicitly of a "mandate," =
a word=20
      equivalent to "mission." He directly links the mission which Jesus =

      entrusts to his disciples with the mission which he himself has =
received=20
      from the Father: "As the Father has sent me, even so I send you" =
(Jn=20
      20:21). Addressing the Father, Jesus says: "As you sent me into =
the world,=20
      so I have sent them into the world" (Jn 17:18). The entire =
missionary=20
      sense of John's Gospel is expressed in the "priestly prayer": =
"This is=20
      eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus =
Christ whom=20
      you have sent" (Jn 17:3). The ultimate purpose of mission is to =
enable=20
      people to share in the communion which exists between the Father =
and the=20
      Son. The disciples are to live in unity with one another, =
remaining in the=20
      Father and the Son, so that the world may know and believe (cf. Jn =

      17:21-23). This is a very important missionary text. It makes us=20
      understand that we are missionaries above all because of <I>what =
we=20
      are</I> as a Church whose innermost life is unity in love, even =
before we=20
      become missionaries <I>in word or deed</I>.</P>
      <P>The four Gospels therefore bear witness to a certain pluralism =
within=20
      the fundamental unity of the same mission, a pluralism which =
reflects=20
      different experiences and situations within the first Christian=20
      communities. It is also the result of the driving force of the =
Spirit=20
      himself; it encourages us to pay heed to the variety or missionary =

      charisms and to the diversity of circumstances and peoples. =
Nevertheless,=20
      all the Evangelists stress that the mission of the disciples is to =

      cooperate in the mission of Christ; "Lo, I am with you always, to =
the=20
      close of the age" (Mt 28:20). Mission, then, is based not on human =

      abilities but on the power of the risen Lord.</P>
      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>The Spirit Directs the Church's Mission</I></B></P>
      <P>24. The mission of the Church, like that of Jesus, is God's =
work or, as=20
      Luke often puts it, the work of the Spirit. After the resurrection =
and=20
      ascension of Jesus, the apostles have a powerful experience which=20
      completely transforms them: the experience of Pentecost. The =
coming of the=20
      Holy Spirit makes them <I>witnesses</I> and <I>prophets</I> (cf. =
Acts 1:8;=20
      2:17-18). It fills them with a serene courage which impels them to =
pass on=20
      to others their experience of Jesus and the hope which motivates =
them. The=20
      Spirit gives them the ability to bear witness to Jesus with=20
      "boldness."<FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana><SUP><A=20

from=20
      Jerusalem, the Spirit becomes even more of a "guide," helping them =
to=20
      choose both those to whom they are to go and the places to which =
their=20
      missionary journey is to take them. The working of the Spirit is=20
      manifested particularly in the impetus given to the mission which, =
in=20
      accordance with Christ's words, spreads out from Jerusalem to all =
of Judea=20
      and Samaria, and to the farthest ends of the earth.</P>
      <P>The Acts of the Apostles records six summaries of the =
"missionary=20
      discourses" which were addressed to the Jews during the Church's =
infancy=20
      (cf. Acts 2:22-39; 3:12-26; 4:9-12; 5:29-32; 10:34-43; 13:16-41). =
These=20
      model speeches, delivered by Peter and by Paul, proclaim Jesus and =
invite=20
      those listening to "be converted," that is, to accept Jesus in =
faith and=20
      to let themselves be transformed in him by the Spirit.</P>
      <P>Paul and Barnabas are impelled by the Spirit to go to the =
Gentiles (cf.=20
      Acts 13:46-48), a development not without certain tensions and =
problems.=20
      How are these converted Gentiles to live their faith in Jesus? Are =
they=20
      bound by the traditions of Judaism and the law of circumcision? At =
the=20
      first Council, which gathers the members of the different churches =

      together with the apostles in Jerusalem, a decision is taken which =
is=20
      acknowledged as coming from the Spirit: it is not necessary for a =
Gentile=20
      to submit to the Jewish Law in order to become a Christian (cf. =
Acts=20
      15:5-11, 28). From now on the Church opens her doors and becomes =
the house=20
      which all may enter, and in which all can feel at home, while =
keeping=20
      their own culture and traditions, provided that these are not =
contrary to=20
      the Gospel.</P>
      <P>25. The missionaries continued along this path, taking into =
account=20
      people's hopes and expectations, their anguish and sufferings, as =
well as=20
      their culture, in order to proclaim to them salvation in Christ. =
The=20
      speeches in Lystra and Athens (cf. Acts 14:15-17; 17:22-31) are=20
      acknowledged as models for the evangelization of the Gentiles. In =
these=20
      speeches Paul enters into "dialogue" with the cultural and =
religious=20
      values of different peoples. To the Lycaonians, who practiced a =
cosmic=20
      religion, he speaks of religious experiences related to the =
cosmos. With=20
      the Greeks he discusses philosophy and quotes their own poets (cf. =
Acts=20
      17:18, 26-28). The God whom Paul wishes to reveal is already =
present in=20
      their lives; indeed, this God has created them and mysteriously =
guides=20
      nations and history. But if they are to recognize the true God, =
they must=20
      abandon the false gods which they themselves have made and open =
themselves=20
      to the One whom God has sent to remedy their ignorance and satisfy =
the=20
      longings of their hearts. These are speeches which offer an =
example of the=20
      inculturation of the Gospel.</P>
      <P>Under the impulse of the Spirit, the Christian faith is =
decisively=20
      opened to the "nations." Witness to Christ spreads to the most =
important=20
      centers of the eastern Mediterranean and then to Rome and the far =
regions=20
      of the West. It is the Spirit who is the source of the drive to =
press on,=20
      not only geographically but also beyond the frontiers of race and=20
      religion, for a truly universal mission.</P>
      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>The Holy Spirit Makes the Whole Church =
Missionary</I></B></P>
      <P>26. The Spirit leads the company of believers to "form a =
community," to=20
      be the Church. After Peter's first proclamation on the day of =
Pentecost=20
      and the conversions that followed, the first community takes shape =
(cf.=20
      Acts 2:42-47; 4:32-35).</P>
      <P>One of the central purposes of mission is to bring people =
together in=20
      hearing the Gospel, in fraternal communion, in prayer and in the=20
      Eucharist. To live in "fraternal communion" (<I>koinonia</I>) =
means to be=20
      "of one heart and soul" (Acts 4:32), establishing fellowship from =
every=20
      point of view: human, spiritual and material. Indeed, a true =
Christian=20
      community is also committed to distributing earthly goods, so that =
no one=20
      is in want, and all can receive such goods "as they need" (cf. =
Acts 2:45;=20
      4:35). The first communities, made up of "glad and generous =
hearts" (Acts=20
      2:46), were open and missionary: they enjoyed "favor with all the =
people"=20
      (Acts 2:47). Even before activity, mission means witness and a way =
of life=20
      that shines out to others.<FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana><SUP><A=20

      <P>27. The Acts of the Apostles indicates that the mission which =
was=20
      directed first to Israel and then to the Gentiles develops on many =
levels.=20
      First and foremost, there is the group of the Twelve which as a =
single=20
      body, led by Peter, proclaims the Good News. Then there is the =
community=20
      of believers, which in its way of life and its activity bears =
witness to=20
      the Lord and converts the Gentiles (cf. Acts 2:46-47). Then there =
are the=20
      special envoys sent out to proclaim the Gospel. Thus the Christian =

      community at Antioch sends its members forth on mission; having =
fasted,=20
      prayed and celebrated the Eucharist, the community recognizes that =
the=20
      Spirit has chosen Paul and Barnabas to be "sent forth" (cf. Acts =
13:1-4).=20
      In its origins, then, mission is seen as a community commitment, a =

      responsibility of the local church, which needs "missionaries" in =
order to=20
      push forward toward new frontiers. Side by side with those who had =
been=20
      sent forth, there were also others, who bore spontaneous witness =
to the=20
      newness which had transformed their lives, and who subsequently =
provided a=20
      link between the emerging communities and the Apostolic =
Church.</P>
      <P>Reading the Acts of the Apostles helps us to realize that at =
the=20
      beginning of the Church the mission <I>ad gentes</I>, while it had =

      missionaries dedicated "for life" by a special vocation, was in =
fact=20
      considered the normal outcome of Christian living, to which every =
believer=20

      <P>This mission is one and undivided, having one origin and one =

      First, there is the missionary activity which we call <I>mission =

      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>A Complex and Ever Changing Religious Picture</I></B></P>
      <P>32. Today we face a religious situation which is extremely =
varied and=20
      changing. Peoples are on the move; social and religious realities =
which=20
      were once clear and well defined are today increasingly complex. =
We need=20
      only think of certain phenomena such as urbanization, mass =
migration, the=20
      flood of refugees, the de-Christianization of countries with =
ancient=20
      Christian traditions, the increasing influence of the Gospel and =
its=20
      values in overwhelmingly non-Christian countries, and the =
proliferation of=20
      messianic cults and religious sects. Religious and social upheaval =
makes=20
      it difficult to apply in practice certain ecclesial distinctions =
and=20
      categories to which we have become accustomed. Even before the =
Council it=20
      was said that some Christian cities and countries had become =
"mission=20
      territories"; the situation has certainly not improved in the =
years since=20
      then.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, missionary work has been very fruitful =
throughout=20
      the world, so that there are now well-established churches, =
sometimes so=20
      sound and mature that they are able to provide for the needs of =
their own=20
      communities and even send personnel to evangelize in other =
churches and=20
      territories. This is in contrast to some traditionally Christian =
areas=20
      which are in need of re-evangelization. As a result, some are =
questioning=20
      whether it is still appropriate to speak of <I>specific missionary =

      activity</I> or specifically "missionary" areas, or whether we =
should=20
      speak instead of a <I>single missionary situation</I>, with one =
single=20
      mission, the same everywhere. The difficulty of relating this =
complex and=20
      changing reality to the mandate of evangelization is apparent in =
the=20
      "language of mission." For example, there is a certain hesitation =
to use=20
      the terms "mission" and "missionaries," which are considered =
obsolete and=20
      as having negative historical connotations. People prefer to use =
instead=20
      the noun "mission" in the singular and the adjective "missionary" =
to=20
      describe all the Church's activities.</P>
      <P>This uneasiness denotes a real change, one which has certain =
positive=20
      aspects. The so-called return or "repatriation" of the =
<I>missions</I>=20
      into the Church's mission, the insertion of <I>missiology</I> into =

      <I>ecclesiology</I>, and the integration of both areas into the=20
      Trinitarian plan of salvation, have given a fresh impetus to =
missionary=20
      activity itself, which is not considered a marginal task for the =
Church=20
      but is situated at the center of her life, as a fundamental =
commitment of=20
      the whole People of God. Nevertheless, care must be taken to avoid =
the=20
      risk of putting very different situations on the same level and of =

      reducing, or even eliminating, the Church's mission and =
missionaries <I>ad=20
      gentes.</I> To say that the whole Church is missionary does not =
preclude=20
      the existencec of a specific mission <I>ad gentes</I>, just as =
saying that=20
      all Catholics must be missionaries not only does not exclude, but =
actually=20
      requires that there be persons who have a specific vocation to be=20

Christ=20

      <P>Secondly, there are Christian communities with adequate and =
solid=20
      ecclesial structures. They are fervent in their faith and in =
Christian=20
      living. They bear witness to the Gospel in their surroundings and =
have a=20
      sense of commitment to the universal mission. In these communities =
the=20
      Church carries out her activity and pastoral care.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, there is an intermediate situation, particularly in =
countries=20
      with ancient Christian roots, and occasionally in the younger =
Churches as=20
      well, where entire groups of the baptized have lost a living sense =
of the=20
      faith, or even no longer consider themselves members of the =
Church, and=20
      live a life far removed from Christ and his Gospel. In this case =
what is=20
      needed is a "new evangelization" or a "re-evangelization."</P>
      <P>34. Missionary activity proper, namely the mission <I>ad =

      activities inasmuch as it is addressed to groups and settings =

      Church are either absent or insufficient. It can thus be =

      clearly definable, and it is unthinkable to create barriers =

for=20
      this is the first task of the Church, which has been sent forth to =
all=20

it.</P>
      <P>Also to be noted is the real and growing <I>interdependence</I> =
which=20

of them=20
      influences, stimulates and assists the others. The missionary =
thrust=20

the=20
      non-Christians at home. Hence missionary activity <I>ad intra</I> =

      <P><B><I>To All Peoples, In Spite of Difficulties</I></B></P>
      <P>35. The mission <I>ad gentes</I> faces an enormous task, which =
is in no=20

      demographic increase and from the socio-cultural standpoint of the =

      <P>The <I>difficulties</I> seem insurmountable and could easily =
lead to=20
      discouragement, if it were a question of a merely human =

      certain countries missionaries are refused entry. In others, not =
only is=20

Christian=20

      <P>Situations are not, however, the same everywhere. While =
acknowledging=20
      that statements about the missionary responsibility of the Church =
are not=20
      credible unless they are backed up by a serious commitment to a =
new=20
      evangelization in the traditionally Christian countries, it does =
not seem=20
      justified to regard as identical the situation of a people which =
has never=20
      known Jesus Christ and that of a people which has known him, =
accepted him=20
      and then rejected him, while continuing to live in a culture which =
in=20
      large part has absorbed gospel principles and values. These are =
two=20
      basically different situations with regard to the faith.</P>
      <P>Thus the criterion of geography, although somewhat imprecise =
and always=20
      provisional, is still a valid indicator of the frontiers toward =
which=20
      missionary activity must be directed. There are countries and =
geographical=20
      and cultural areas which lack indigenous Christian communities. In =
other=20
      places, these communities are so small as not to be a clear sign =
of a=20
      Christian presence; or they lack the dynamism to evangelize their=20
      societies, or belong to a minority population not integrated into =
the=20
      dominant culture of the nation. Particularly in Asia, toward which =
the=20
      Church's mission<I> ad gentes</I> ought to be chiefly directed, =
Christians=20
      are a small minority, even though sometimes there are significant =
numbers=20
      of converts and outstanding examples of Christian presence.</P>
      <P>(b) <I>New worlds and new social phenomena.</I></P>
      <P>The rapid and profound transformations which characterize =
today's=20
      world, especially in the southern hemisphere, are having a =
powerful effect=20
      on the overall missionary picture. Where before there were stable =
human=20
      and social situations, today everything is in flux. One thinks, =
for=20
      example, of urbanization and the massive growth of cities, =
especially=20
      where demographic pressure is greatest. In not a few countries, =
over half=20
      the population already lives in a few "megalopolises," where human =

      problems are often aggravated by the feeling of anonymity =
experienced by=20
      masses of people.</P>
      <P>In the modern age, missionary activity has been carried out =
especially=20
      in isolated regions which are far from centers of civilization and =
which=20
      are hard to penetrate because of difficulties of communication, =
language=20
      or climate. Today the image of mission <I>ad gentes</I> is perhaps =

      changing: efforts should be concentrated on the big cities, where =
new=20
      customs and styles of living arise together with new forms of =
culture and=20
      communication, which then influence the wider population. It is =
true that=20
      the "option for the neediest" means that we should not overlook =
the most=20
      abandoned and isolated human groups, but it is also true that =
individual=20
      or small groups cannot be evangelized if we neglect the centers =
where a=20
      new humanity, so to speak, is emerging, and where new models of=20
      development are taking shape. The future of the younger nations is =
being=20
      shaped in the cities.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the future, we cannot forget the young, who in many =

      countries comprise more than half the population. How do we bring =
the=20
      message of Christ to non-Christian young people who represent the =
future=20
      of entire continents? Clearly, the ordinary means of pastoral work =
are not=20
      sufficient: what are needed are associations, institutions, =
special=20
      centers and groups, and cultural and social initiatives for young =
people.=20
      This is a field where modern ecclesial movements have ample room =
for=20
      involvement.</P>
      <P>Among the great changes taking place in the contemporary world, =

      migration has produced a new phenomenon: non-Christians are =
becoming very=20
      numerous in traditionally Christian countries, creating fresh=20
      opportunities for contacts and cultural exchanges, and calling the =
Church=20
      to hospitality, dialogue, assistance and, in a word, fraternity. =
Among=20
      migrants, refugees occupy a very special place and deserve the =
greatest=20
      attention. Today there are many millions of refugees in the world =
and=20
      their number is constantly increasing. They have fled from =
conditions of=20
      political oppression and inhuman misery, from famine and drought =
of=20
      catastrophic proportions. The Church must make them part of her =
overall=20
      apostolic concern.</P>
      <P>Finally, we may mention the situations of poverty - often on an =

      intolerable scale - which have been created in not a few =
countries, and=20
      which are often the cause of mass migration. The community of =
believers in=20
      Christ is challenged by these inhuman situations: the proclamation =
of=20
      Christ and the kingdom of God must become the means for restoring =
the=20
      human dignity of these people.</P>
      <P><I>(c)</I> <I>Cultural sectors: the modern equivalents of the=20
      Areopagus.</I></P>
      <P>After preaching in a number of places, St. Paul arrived in =
Athens,=20
      where he went to the Areopagus and proclaimed the Gospel in =
language=20
      appropriate to and understandable in those surroundings (cf. Acts=20
      17:22-31). At that time the Areopagus represented the cultural =
center of=20
      the learned people of Athens, and today it can be taken as a =
symbol of the=20
      new sectors in which the Gospel must be proclaimed.</P>
      <P>The first Areopagus of the modern age is the <I>world of=20
      communications</I>, which is unifying humanity and turning it into =
what is=20
      known as a "global village." The means of social communication =
have become=20
      so important as to be for many the chief means of information and=20
      education, of guidance and inspiration in their behavior as =
individuals,=20
      families and within society at large. In particular, the younger=20
      generation is growing up in a world conditioned by the mass media. =
To some=20
      degree perhaps this Areopagus has been neglected. Generally, =
preference=20
      has been given to other means of preaching the Gospel and of =
Christian=20
      education, while the mass media are left to the initiative of =
individuals=20
      or small groups and enter into pastoral planning only in a =
secondary way.=20
      Involvement in the mass media, however, is not meant merely to =
strengthen=20
      the preaching of the Gospel. There is a deeper reality involved =
here:=20
      since the very evangelization of modern culture depends to a great =
extent=20
      on the influence of the media, it is not enough to use the media =
simply to=20
      spread the Christian message and the Church's authentic teaching. =
It is=20
      also necessary to integrate that message into the "new culture" =
created by=20
      modern communications. This is a complex issue, since the "new =
culture"=20
      originates not just from whatever content is eventually expressed, =
but=20
      from the very fact that there exist new ways of communicating, =
with new=20
      languages, new techniques and a new psychology. Pope Paul VI said =
that=20
      "the split between the Gospel and culture is undoubtedly the =
tragedy of=20
      our time,"<FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana><SUP><A=20

      name=3D-1Q>62</A></SUP></FONT> and the field of communications =
fully=20
      confirms this judgment.</P>
      <P>There are many other forms of the "Areopagus" in the modern =
world=20
      toward which the Church's missionary activity ought to be =
directed; for=20
      example, commitment to peace, development and the liberation of =
peoples;=20
      the rights of individuals and peoples, especially those of =
minorities; the=20
      advancement of women and children; safeguarding the created world. =
These=20
      too are areas which need to be illuminated with the light of the=20
      Gospel.</P>
      <P>We must also mention the immense "Areopagus" of culture, =
scientific=20
      research, and international relations which promote dialogue and =
open up=20
      new possibilities. We would do well to be attentive to these =
modern areas=20
      of activity and to be involved in them. People sense that they =
are, as it=20
      were, traveling together across life's sea, and that they are =
called to=20
      ever greater unity and solidarity. Solutions to pressing problems =
must be=20
      studied, discussed and worked out with the involvement of all. =
That is why=20
      international organizations and meetings are proving increasingly=20
      important in many sectors of human life, from culture to politics, =
from=20
      the economy to research. Christians who live and work in this=20
      international sphere must always remember their duty to bear =
witness to=20
      the Gospel.</P>
      <P>38. Our times are both momentous and fascinating. While on the =
one hand=20
      people seem to be pursuing material prosperity and to be sinking =
ever=20
      deeper into consumerism and materialism, on the other hand we are=20
      witnessing a desperate search for meaning, the need for an inner =
life, and=20
      a desire to learn new forms and methods of meditation and prayer. =
Not only=20
      in cultures with strong religious elements, but also in =
secularized=20
      societies, the spiritual dimension of life is being sought after =
as an=20
      antidote to dehumanization. This phenomenon-the so-called =
"religious=20
      revival"-is not without ambiguity, but it also represents an =
opportunity.=20
      The Church has an immense spiritual patrimony to offer humankind, =
a=20
      heritage in Christ, who called himself "the way, and the truth, =
and the=20
      life" (Jn 14:6): it is the Christian path to meeting God, to =
prayer, to=20
      asceticism, and to the search for life's meaning. Here too there =
is an=20

      <P>Proclamation is inspired by faith, which gives rise to =
enthusiasm and=20
      fervor in the missionary. As already mentioned, the Acts of the =
Apostles=20
      uses the word <I>parrhesia</I> to describe this attitude, a word =
which=20
      means to speak frankly and with courage. This term is found also =
in St.=20
      Paul: "We had courage in our God to declare to you the Gospel of =
God in=20
      the face of great opposition" (1 Th 2:2); "Pray...also for me, =
that=20
      utterance may be given me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim =
the=20
      mystery of the Gospel for which I am an ambassador in chains; that =
I may=20
      declare it boldly, as I ought to speak" (Eph 6:18-20).</P>
      <P>In proclaiming Christ to non-Christians, the missionary is =
convinced=20
      that, through the working of the Spirit, there already exists in=20
      individuals and peoples an expectation, even if an unconscious =
one, of=20
      knowing the truth about God, about man, and about how we are to be =
set=20
      free from sin and death. The missionary's enthusiasm in =
proclaiming Christ=20
      comes from the conviction that he is responding to that =
expectation, and=20
      so he does not become discouraged or cease his witness even when =
he is=20
      called to manifest his faith in an environment that is hostile or=20
      indifferent. He knows that the Spirit of the Father is speaking =
through=20
      him (cf. Mt 10:17-20; Lk 12:11-12) and he can say with the =
apostles: "We=20
      are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit" (Acts =
5:32). He=20
      knows that he is not proclaiming a human truth, but the "word of =
God,"=20
      which has an intrinsic and mysterious power of its own (cf. Rom =
1:16).</P>
      <P>The supreme test is the giving of one's life, to the point of =
accepting=20
      death in order to bear witness to one's faith in Jesus Christ. =
Throughout=20
      Christian history, martyrs, that is, "witnesses," have always been =

      numerous and indispensable to the spread of the Gospel. In our own =
age,=20
      there are many: bishops, priests, men and women religious, lay=20
      people-often unknown heroes who give their lives to bear witness =
to the=20
      faith. They are<I> par excellence</I> the heralds and witnesses of =
the=20
      faith.</P>
      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>Conversion and Baptism</I></B></P>
      <P>46. The proclamation of the Word of God has <I>Christian =
conversion</I>=20
      as its aim: a complete and sincere adherence to Christ and his =
Gospel=20
      through faith. Conversion is a gift of God, a work of the Blessed =
Trinity.=20
      It is the Spirit who opens people's hearts so that they can =
believe in=20
      Christ and "confess him'' (cf. 1 Cor 12:3); of those who draw near =
to him=20
      through faith Jesus says: "No one can come to me unless the Father =
who=20
      sent me draws him" (Jn 6:44).</P>
      <P>From the outset, conversion is expressed in faith which is =
total and=20
      radical, and which neither limits nor hinders God's gift. At the =
same=20
      time, it gives rise to a dynamic and lifelong process which =
demands a=20
      continual turning away from "life according to the flesh" to "life =

      according to the Spirit" (cf. Rom 8:3-13). Conversion means =
accepting, by=20
      a personal decision, the saving sovereignty of Christ and becoming =
his=20
      disciple.</P>
      <P>The Church calls all people to this conversion, following the =
example=20
      of John the Baptist, who prepared the way for Christ by "preaching =
a=20
      baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins" (Mk 1:4), as =
well as=20
      the example of Christ himself, who "after John was =
arrested,...came into=20
      Galilee preaching the Gospel of God and saying: 'The time is =
fulfilled,=20
      and the kingdom of God is at hand; <I>repent</I> and believe in =
the=20
      Gospel'" (Mk 1:14-15).</P>
      <P>Nowadays the call to conversion which missionaries address to=20
      non-Christians is put into question or passed over in silence. It =
is seen=20
      as an act of "proselytizing"; it is claimed that it is enough to =
help=20
      people to become more human or more faithful to their own =
religion, that=20
      it is enough to build communities capable of working for justice, =
freedom,=20
      peace and solidarity. What is overlooked is that every person has =
the=20
      right to hear the "Good News" of the God who reveals and gives =
himself in=20
      Christ, so that each one can live out in its fullness his or her =
proper=20
      calling. This lofty reality is expressed in the words of Jesus to =
the=20
      Samaritan woman: "If you knew the gift of God," and in the =
unconscious but=20
      ardent desire of the woman: "Sir, give me this water, that I may =
not=20
      thirst" (Jn 4:10, 15).</P>
      <P>47. The apostles, prompted by the Spirit, invited all to change =
their=20
      lives, to be converted and to be baptized. Immediately after the =
event of=20
      Pentecost, Peter spoke convincingly to the crowd: "When they heard =
this,=20
      they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the=20
      Apostles, 'Brethren, what shall we do?' And Peter said to them,=20
      '<I>Repent</I>, and be baptized every one of you in the name of =
Jesus=20
      Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the =
gift of=20
      the Holy Spirit'" (Acts 2:37-38). That very day some three =
thousand=20
      persons were baptized. And again, after the healing of the lame =
man, Peter=20
      spoke to the crowd and repeated: "Repent therefore, and turn =
again, that=20
      your sins may be blotted out!" (Acts 3:19)</P>
      <P>Conversion to Christ is joined to Baptism not only because of =
the=20
      Church's practice, but also by the will of Christ himself, who =
sent the=20
      apostles to make disciples of all nations and to baptize them (cf. =
Mt=20
      28:19). Conversion is also joined to Baptism because of the =
intrinsic need=20
      to receive the fullness of new life in Christ. As Jesus says to =
Nicodemus:=20
      "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the =
Spirit,=20
      he cannot enter the kingdom of God" (Jn 3:5). In Baptism, in fact, =
we are=20
      born anew to the life of God's children, united to Jesus Christ =
and=20
      anointed in the Holy Spirit. Baptism is not simply a seal of =
conversion,=20
      and a kind of external sign indicating conversion and attesting to =
it.=20
      Rather, it is the sacrament which signifies and effects rebirth =
from the=20
      Spirit, establishes real and unbreakable bonds with the Blessed =
Trinity,=20
      and makes us members of the Body of Christ, which is the =
Church.</P>
      <P>All this needs to be said, since not a few people, precisely in =
those=20
      areas involved in the mission <I>ad gentes</I>, tend to separate=20
      conversion to Christ from Baptism, regarding Baptism as =
unnecessary. It is=20
      true that in some places sociological considerations associated =
with=20
      Baptism obscure its genuine meaning as an act of faith. This is =
due to a=20
      variety of historical and cultural factors which must be removed =
where=20
      they still exist, so that the sacrament of spiritual rebirth can =
be seen=20
      for what it truly is. Local ecclesial communities must devote =
themselves=20
      to this task. It is also true that many profess an interior =
commitment to=20
      Christ and his message yet do not wish to be committed =
sacramentally,=20
      since, owing to prejudice or because of the failings of =
Christians, they=20
      find it difficult to grasp the true nature of the Church as a =
mystery of=20
      faith and love.<FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana><SUP><A=20

      <P>Certainly, every convert is a gift to the Church and represents =
a=20
      serious responsibility for her, not only because converts have to =
be=20

by=20

of=20

enthusiasm=20

      Notwithstanding the high number of dioceses, there are still very =

and=20
      developing the Church. This phase of ecclesial history, called the =

      <I>plantatio Ecclesiae</I>, has not reached its end; indeed, for =
much of=20
      the human race it has yet to begin.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for this task belongs to the universal Church =
and to the=20
      particular churches, to the whole people of God and to all its =
missionary=20
      forces. Every church, even one made up of recent converts, is =
missionary=20
      by its very nature, and is both evangelized and evangelizing. =
Faith must=20
      always be presented as a gift of God to be lived out in community=20
      (families, parishes, associations), and to be extended to others =
through=20
      witness in word and deed. The evangelizing activity of the =
Christian=20
      community, first in its own locality, and then elsewhere as part =
of the=20
      Church's universal mission, is the clearest sign of a mature =
faith. A=20
      radical conversion in thinking is required in order to become =
missionary,=20
      and this holds true both for individuals and entire communities. =
The Lord=20
      is always calling us to come out of ourselves and to share with =
others the=20
      goods we possess, starting with the most precious gift of all - =
our faith.=20
      The effectiveness of the Church's organizations, movements, =
parishes and=20
      apostolic works must be measured in the light of this missionary=20
      imperative. Only by becoming missionary will the Christian =
community be=20
      able to overcome its internal divisions and tensions, and =
rediscover its=20
      unity and its strength of faith.</P>
      <P>Missionary personnel coming from other churches and countries =
must work=20
      in communion with their local counterparts for the development of =
the=20
      Christian community. In particular, it falls to missionary =
personnel - in=20
      accordance with the directives of the bishops and in cooperation =
with=20
      those responsible at the local level - to foster the spread of the =
faith=20
      and the expansion of the Church in non-Christian environments and =
among=20
      non-Christian groups, and to encourage a missionary sense within =
the=20
      particular churches, so that pastoral concern will always be =
combined with=20
      concern for the mission <I>ad gentes</I>. In this way, every =
church will=20
      make its own the solicitude of Christ the Good Shepherd, who fully =
devotes=20
      himself to his flock, but at the same time is mindful of the =
"other sheep,=20
      that are not of this fold." (Jn 10:16)</P>
      <P>50. This solicitude will serve as a motivation and stimulus for =
a=20
      renewed commitment to ecumenism. The relationship between =
<I>ecumenical=20
      activity</I> and<I> missionary activity</I> makes it necessary to =
consider=20
      two closely associated factors. On the one hand, we must recognize =
that=20

      <P>61. Without witnesses there can be no witness, just as without=20

and sends=20
      people forth to be his witnesses and apostles, so that they may =
share in=20
      his mission and continue in his saving work: "You shall be my =
witnesses in=20
      Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the =
earth" (Acts=20
      1:8).</P>
      <P>The Twelve are the first to work in the Church's universal =
mission.=20
      They constitute a "collegial subject" of that mission, having been =
chosen=20
      by Jesus to be with him and to be sent forth "to the lost sheep of =
the=20
      house of Israel" (Mt 10:6). This collegiality does not prevent =
certain=20
      figures from assuming prominence within the group, such as James, =
John and=20
      above all Peter, who is so prominent as to justify the expression: =
"Peter=20
      and the other Apostles" (Acts 2:14, 37). It was thanks to Peter =
that the=20
      horizons of the Church's universal mission were expanded, and the =
way was=20
      prepared for the outstanding missionary work of Paul, who by God's =
will=20
      was called and sent forth to the nations (cf. Gal 1:15-16).</P>
      <P>In the early Church's missionary expansion, we find alongside =
the=20
      apostles, other lesser figures who should not be overlooked. These =
include=20
      individuals, groups and communities. A typical example is the =
local church=20
      at Antioch which, after being evangelized, becomes an evangelizing =

      community which sends missionaries to others (cf. Acts 13:2-3). =
The early=20
      Church experiences her mission as a community task, while =
acknowledging in=20
      her midst certain "special envoys" or "missionaries devoted to the =

      Gentiles," such as Paul and Barnabas.</P>

its=20
      universal mission remains valid and urgent today.<I> The Church is =

something=20

      follows that the universal Church and each individual church is =

      <P>77. Since they are members of the Church by virtue of their =
Baptism,=20
      all Christians share responsibility for missionary activity. =
"Missionary=20
      cooperation" is the expression used to describe the sharing by =
communities=20
      and individual Christians in this right and duty.</P>
      <P>Missionary cooperation is rooted and lived, above all, in =
personal=20
      union with Christ. Only if we are united to him as the branches to =
the=20
      vine (cf. Jn 15:5) can we produce good fruit. Through holiness of =
life=20
      every Christian can become a fruitful part of the Church's =
mission. The=20
      Second Vatican Council invited all "to a profound interior =
renewal, so=20
      that having a lively awareness of their personal responsibility =
for the=20
      spreading of the Gospel, they may play their part in missionary =

      <P>Sharing in the universal mission therefore is not limited to =
certain=20
      specific activities, but is the sign of maturity in faith and of a =

      Christian life that bears fruit. In this way, individual believers =
extend=20
      the reach of their charity and show concern for those both far and =
near.=20
      They pray for the missions and missionary vocations. They help=20
      missionaries and follow their work with interest. And when =
missionaries=20
      return, they welcome them with the same joy with which the first =
Christian=20
      communities heard from the apostles the marvelous things which God =
had=20
      wrought through their preaching (cf. Acts 14:27).</P>
      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>Prayer and Sacrifice for Missionaries</I></B></P>
      <P>78. Among the forms of sharing, first place goes to spiritual=20
      cooperation through prayer, sacrifice and the witness of Christian =
life.=20
      Prayer should accompany the journey of missionaries so that the=20
      proclamation of the word will be effective through God's grace. In =
his=20
      Letters, St. Paul often asks the faithful to pray for him so that =
he might=20
      proclaim the Gospel with confidence and conviction. Prayer needs =
to be=20
      accompanied by sacrifice. The redemptive value of suffering, =
accepted and=20
      offered to God with love, derives from the sacrifice of Christ =
himself,=20
      who calls the members of his Mystical Body to share in his =
sufferings, to=20
      complete them in their own flesh (cf. Col 1:24). The sacrifice of=20
      missionaries should be shared and accompanied by the sacrifices of =
all the=20
      faithful. I therefore urge those engaged in the pastoral care of =
the sick=20
      to teach them about the efficacy of suffering, and to encourage =
them to=20
      offer their sufferings to God for missionaries. By making such an=20
      offering, the sick themselves become missionaries, as emphasized =
by a=20
      number of movements which have sprung up among them and for them. =
The=20
      solemnity of Pentecost - the beginning of the Church's mission - =
is=20
      celebrated in some communities as a "Day of Suffering for the=20
      Missions."</P>
      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>"Here I am, Lord! I am ready! Send me!"</I></B> (cf. Is =
6:8)</P>
      <P>79. Cooperation is expressed above all by promoting missionary=20
      vocations. While acknowledging the validity of various ways of =
being=20
      involved in missionary activity, it is necessary at the same time =
to=20
      reaffirm that <I>a full and lifelong commitment to the work of the =

      missions holds pride of place</I>, especially in missionary =
institutes and=20
      congregations. Promoting such vocations is at the heart of =
missionary=20
      cooperation. Preaching the Gospel requires preachers; the harvest =
needs=20
      laborers. The mission is carried out above all by men and women =
who are=20
      consecrated for life to the work of the Gospel and are prepared to =
go=20
      forth into the whole world to bring salvation.</P>
      <P>I wish to call to mind and to recommend this<I> concern for =
missionary=20
      vocations</I>. Conscious of the overall responsibility of =
Christians to=20
      contribute to missionary activity and to the development of poorer =

      peoples, we must ask ourselves how it is that in some countries, =
while=20
      monetary contributions are on the increase, missionary vocations, =
which=20
      are the real measure of self-giving to one's brothers and sisters, =
are in=20
      danger of disappearing. Vocations to the priesthood and the =
consecrated=20
      life are a sure sign of the vitality of a church.</P>
      <P>80. As I think of this serious problem, I appeal with great =
confidence=20
      and affection to families and to young people. Families, =
especially=20
      parents, should be conscious that they ought to "offer a special=20

      <P>An intense prayer life, a genuine sense of service to one's =
neighbor=20
      and a generous participation in Church activities provide families =
with=20
      conditions that favor vocations among young people. When parents =
are ready=20
      to allow one of their children to leave for the missions, when =
they have=20
      sought this grace from the Lord, he will repay them, in joy, on =

      that their son or daughter hears his call.</P>
      <P>I ask young people themselves to listen to Christ's words as he =
says to=20
      them what he once said to Simon Peter and to Andrew at the =
lakeside:=20
      "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men" (Mt 4:19). May =
they have=20
      the courage to reply as Isaiah did: "Here am I, Lord! I am ready! =
Send=20
      me!" (cf. Is 6:8) They will have a wonderful life ahead of them, =
and they=20

      <P>81. The material and financial needs of the missions are many: =
not only=20
      to set up the Church with minimal structures (chapels, schools for =

      catechists and seminarians, housing), but also to support works of =

      charity, education and human promotion-a vast field of action =
especially=20
      in poor countries. The missionary Church gives what she receives, =
and=20
      distributes to the poor the material goods that her materially =
richer sons=20
      and daughters generously put at her disposal. Here I wish to thank =
all=20
      those who make sacrifices and contribute to the work of the =
missions.=20
      Their sacrifices and sharing are indispensable for building up the =
Church=20
      and for showing love.</P>
      <P>In the matter of material help, it is important to consider the =
spirit=20
      in which donations are made. For this we should reassess our own =
way of=20
      living: the missions ask not only for a contribution but for a =
sharing in=20
      the work of preaching and charity toward the poor. All that we =
have=20
      received from God - life itself as well as material goods - does =
not=20
      belong to us but is given to us for our use. Generosity in giving =
must=20
      always be enlightened and inspired by faith: then we will truly be =
more=20
      blessed in giving than in receiving.</P>
      <P><I>World Mission Day</I>, which seeks to heighten awareness of =
the=20
      missions, as well as to collect funds for them, is an important =
date in=20
      the life of the Church, because it teaches how to give: as an =
offering=20
      made to God, <I>in</I> the Eucharistic celebration and <I>for</I> =
all the=20
      missions of the world.</P>
      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>New Forms of Missionary Cooperation</I></B></P>
      <P>82. Today, cooperation includes new forms-not only economic =
assistance,=20
      but also direct participation. New situations connected with the=20
      phenomenon of mobility demand from Christians an authentic =
missionary=20
      spirit.</P>
      <P>International tourism has now become a mass phenomenon. This is =
a=20
      positive development if tourists maintain an attitude of respect =
and a=20
      desire for mutual cultural enrichment, avoiding ostentation and =
waste, and=20
      seeking contact with other people. But Christians are expected =
above all=20
      to be aware of their obligation to bear witness always to their =
faith and=20
      love of Christ. Firsthand knowledge of the missionary life and of =
new=20
      Christian communities also can be an enriching experience and can=20
      strengthen one's faith. Visiting the missions is commendable, =
especially=20
      on the part of young people who go there to serve and to gain an =
intense=20
      experience of the Christian life.</P>
      <P>Reasons of work nowadays bring many Christians from young =
communities=20
      to areas where Christianity is unknown and at times prohibited or=20
      persecuted. The same is true of members of the faithful from =
traditionally=20
      Christian countries who work for a time in non-Christian =
countries. These=20
      circumstances are certainly an opportunity to live the faith and =
to bear=20
      witness to it. In the early centuries, Christianity spread because =

      Christians, traveling to or settling in regions where Christ had =
not yet=20
      been proclaimed, bore courageous witness to their faith and =
founded the=20
      first communities there.</P>
      <P>More numerous are the citizens of mission countries and =
followers of=20
      non-Christian religions who settle in other nations for reasons of =
study=20
      or work, or are forced to do so because of the political or =
economic=20
      situations in their native lands. The presence of these brothers =
and=20
      sisters in traditionally Christian countries is a challenge for =
the=20
      ecclesial communities, and a stimulus to hospitality, dialogue, =
service,=20
      sharing, witness and direct proclamation. In Christian countries,=20
      communities and cultural groups are also forming which call for =
the=20
      mission <I>ad gentes</I>, and the local churches, with the help of =

      personnel from the immigrants' own countries and of returning=20
      missionaries, should respond generously to these situations.</P>
      <P>Missionary cooperation can also involve leaders in politics, =
economics,=20
      culture and journalism, as well as experts of the various =
international=20
      bodies. In the modern world it is becoming increasingly difficult =
to=20
      determine geographical or cultural boundaries. There is an =
increasing=20
      interdependence between peoples, and this constitutes a stimulus =
for=20
      Christian witness and evangelization.</P>
      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>Missionary Promotion and Formation Among the People of=20

      <P>83. Missionary formation is the task of the local Church, =
assisted by=20
      missionaries and their institutes, and by personnel from the young =

      churches. This work must be seen not as peripheral but as central =
to the=20
      Christian life. Even for the "new evangelization" of Christian =
countries=20
      the theme of the missions can prove very helpful: the witness of=20
      missionaries retains its appeal even for the non-practicing and=20
      non-believers, and it communicates Christian values. Particular =
churches=20
      should therefore make the promotion of the missions a key element =
in the=20
      normal pastoral activity of parishes, associations and groups, =
especially=20
      youth groups.</P>
      <P>With this end in view, it is necessary to spread information =
through=20
      missionary publications and audiovisual aids. These play an =
important role=20
      in making known the life of the universal Church and in voicing =
the=20
      experiences of missionaries and of the local churches in which =
they work.=20
      In those younger churches which are still not able to have a press =
and=20
      other means of their own, it is important that missionary =
institutes=20
      devote personnel and resources to these undertakings.</P>
      <P>Such formation is entrusted to priests and their associates, to =

      educators and teachers, and to theologians, particularly those who =
teach=20
      in seminaries and centers for the laity. Theological training =
cannot and=20
      should not ignore the Church's universal mission, ecumenism, the =
study of=20
      the great religions and missiology. I recommend that such studies =
be=20
      undertaken especially in seminaries and in houses of formation for =
men and=20
      women religious, ensuring that some priests or other students =
specialize=20
      in the different fields of missiology.</P>
      <P>Activities aimed at promoting interest in the missions must =
always be=20
      geared to these specific goals; namely, informing and forming the =
People=20
      of God to share in the Church's universal mission, promoting =
vocations=20
      <I>ad gentes </I>and encouraging cooperation in the work of=20
      evangelization. It is not right to give an incomplete picture of=20
      missionary activity, as if it consisted principally in helping the =
poor,=20
      contributing to the liberation of the oppressed, promoting =
development or=20
      defending human rights. The missionary Church is certainly =
involved on=20
      these fronts but her primary task lies elsewhere: the poor are =
hungry for=20
      God, not just for bread and freedom. Missionary activity must =
first of all=20
      bear witness to and proclaim salvation in Christ, and establish =
local=20
      churches which then become means of liberation in every sense.</P>

      <P>I exhort all the churches, and the bishops, priests, religious =

universality</I>, and=20
      to avoid every form of provincialism or exclusiveness, or feelings =
of=20
      self-sufficiency. Local churches, although rooted in their own =
people and=20
      their own culture, must always maintain an effective sense of the=20
      universality of the faith, giving and receiving spiritual gifts,=20
      experiences of pastoral work in evangelization and initial =
proclamation,=20
      as well as personnel for the apostolate and material =
resources.</P>
      <P>The temptation to become isolated can be a strong one. The =
older=20
      churches, involved in new evangelization, may think that their =
mission is=20
      now at home, and thus they may risk slackening their drive toward =
the=20
      non-Christian world, begrudgingly conceding vocations to =
missionary=20
      institutes, religious congregations or other particular churches. =
But it=20
      is by giving generously of what we have that we will receive. =
Already the=20
      young churches, many of which are blessed with an abundance of =
vocations,=20
      are in a position to send priests and men and women religious to =
the older=20
      churches.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the young churches are concerned about their =
own=20
      identity, about inculturation, and about their freedom to grow=20
      independently of external influences, with the possible result =
that they=20
      close their doors to missionaries. To these churches I say: Do not =
isolate=20
      yourselves; willingly accept missionaries and support from other =
churches,=20
      and do likewise throughout the world. Precisely because of the =
problems=20
      that concern you, you need to be in continuous contact with your =
brothers=20
      and sisters in the faith. With every legitimate means, seek to =
ensure=20
      recognition of the freedom to which you have a right, remembering =
that=20
      Christ's disciples must "obey God rather than men" (Acts =
5:29).</P>

      <P>86. If we look at today's world, we are struck by many negative =
factors=20
      that can lead to pessimism. But this feeling is unjustified: we =
have faith=20
      in God our Father and Lord, in his goodness and mercy. As the =
third=20
      millennium of the redemption draws near, God is preparing a great=20

signs. In=20
      fact, both in the non-Christian world and in the traditionally =
Christian=20

values, a=20
      development which the Church seeks to encourage. Today in fact =
there is a=20
      new consensus among peoples about these values: the rejection of =
violence=20
      and war; respect for the human person and for human rights; the =
desire for=20
      freedom, justice and brotherhood; the surmounting of different =
forms of=20
      racism and nationalism; the affirmation of the dignity and role of =

      women.</P>
      <P>Christian hope sustains us in committing ourselves fully to the =
new=20

as Jesus=20
      taught us: "Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is =
in=20
      heaven" (Mt 6:10).</P>
      <P>The number of those awaiting Christ is still immense: the human =

Church is=20

all the=20

the year=20
      2000, the whole Church is even more committed to a new missionary =
advent.=20
      We must increase our apostolic zeal to pass on to others the light =
and joy=20
      of the faith, and to this high ideal the whole People of God must =
be=20

      <P>We cannot be content when we consider the millions of our =
brothers=20

but who=20
      live in ignorance of the love of God. For each believer, as for =
the entire=20

      <P>87. Missionary activity demands a specific spirituality, which =

missionaries.</P>
      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>Being Led by the Spirit</I></B></P>
      <P>This spirituality is expressed first of all by a life of =
complete=20
      docility to the Spirit. It commits us to being molded from within =
by the=20
      Spirit, so that we may become ever more like Christ. It is not =
possible to=20
      bear witness to Christ without reflecting his image, which is made =
alive=20
      in us by grace and the power of the Spirit. This docility then =
commits us=20
      to receive the gifts of fortitude and discernment, which are =
essential=20
      elements of missionary spirituality.</P>
      <P>An example of this is found with the apostles during the =
Master's=20
      public life. Despite their love for him and their generous =
response to his=20
      call, they proved to be incapable of understanding his words and =
reluctant=20
      to follow him along the path of suffering and humiliation. The =
Spirit=20
      transformed them into courageous witnesses to Christ and =
enlightened=20
      heralds of his word. It was the Spirit himself who guided them =
along the=20
      difficult and new paths of mission.</P>
      <P>Today, as in the past, that mission is difficult and complex, =
and=20
      demands the courage and light of the Spirit. We often experience =
the=20
      dramatic situation of the first Christian community which =
witnessed=20
      unbelieving and hostile forces "gathered together against the Lord =
and his=20
      Anointed" (Acts 4:26). Now, as then, we must pray that God will =
grant us=20
      boldness in preaching the Gospel; we must ponder the mysterious =
ways of=20
      the Spirit and allow ourselves to be led by him into all the truth =
(cf. Jn=20

      <P><B><I>Living the Mystery of Christ, "the One who was =

      <P>88. An essential characteristic of missionary spirituality is =
intimate=20
      communion with Christ. We cannot understand or carry out the =
mission=20
      unless we refer it to Christ as the one who was sent to =
evangelize. St.=20
      Paul describes Christ's attitude: "Have this mind among =
yourselves, which=20
      is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, =
did not=20
      count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied =
himself, taking=20
      the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And =
being found=20
      in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, =
even=20
      death on a cross" (Phil 2:5-8).</P>
      <P>The mystery of the Incarnation and Redemption is thus described =
as a=20
      total self-emptying which leads Christ to experience fully the =
human=20
      condition and to accept totally the Father's plan. This is an =
emptying of=20
      self which is permeated by love and expresses love. The mission =
follows=20
      this same path and leads to the foot of the cross.</P>
      <P>The missionary is required to "renounce himself and everything =
that up=20

      (1 Cor 9:22-23).</P>
      <P>It is precisely because he is "sent" that the missionary =
experiences=20
      the consoling presence of Christ, who is with him at every moment =
of life=20
      - "Do not be afraid...for I am with you" (Acts 18:9-10) - and who =
awaits=20
      him in the heart of every person.</P>
      <P><B><I></I></B></P>
      <P><B><I>Loving the Church and Humanity As Jesus Did</I></B></P>
      <P>89. Missionary spirituality is also marked by apostolic =
charity, the=20
      charity of Christ who came "to gather into one the children of God =
who are=20
      scattered abroad" (Jn 11:52), of the Good Shepherd who knows his =
sheep,=20
      who searches them out and offers his life for them (cf. Jn 10). =
Those who=20
      have the missionary spirit feel Christ's burning love for souls, =
and love=20
      the Church as Christ did.</P>
      <P>The missionary is urged on by "zeal for souls," a zeal inspired =
by=20
      Christ's own charity, which takes the form of concern, tenderness, =

      compassion, openness, availability and interest in people's =
problems.=20
      Jesus' love is very deep: he who "knew what was in man" (Jn 2:25) =
loved=20
      everyone by offering them redemption and suffered when it was=20
rejected.</P>
      <P>The missionary is a person of charity. In order to proclaim to =
all his=20
      brothers and sisters that they are loved by God and are capable of =
loving,=20
      he must show love toward all, giving his life for his neighbor. =
The=20
      missionary is the "universal brother," bearing in himself the =
Church's=20
      spirit, her openness to and interest in all peoples and =
individuals,=20
      especially the least and poorest of his brethren. As such, he =
overcomes=20
      barriers and divisions of race, cast or ideology. He is a sign of =
God's=20
      love in the world - a love without exclusion or partiality.</P>
      <P>Finally, like Christ he must love the Church: "Christ loved the =
Church=20
      and gave himself up for her" (Eph 5:25). This love, even to the =
point of=20
      giving one's life, is a focal point for him. Only profound love =
for the=20
      Church can sustain the missionary's zeal. His daily pressure, as =
St. Paul=20
      says, is "anxiety for all the churches" (2 Cor 11:28). For every=20
      missionary "fidelity to Christ cannot be separated from fidelity =
to the=20
      Church."<FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana><SUP><A=20

      <P>Dear brothers and sisters: let us remember the missionary =
enthusiasm of=20
      the first Christian communities. Despite the limited means of =
travel and=20
      communication in those times, the proclamation of the Gospel =
quickly=20
      reached the ends of the earth. And this was the religion of a man =
who had=20
      died on a cross, "a stumbling block to Jews and folly to =
Gentiles"! (1 Cor=20
      1:23) Underlying this missionary dynamism was the holiness of the =
first=20
      Christians and the first communities.</P>
      <P>91. I therefore address myself to the recently baptized members =
of the=20
      young communities and young churches. Today, you are the hope of =
this=20
      two-thousand-year-old Church of ours: being young in faith, you =
must be=20
      like the first Christians and radiate enthusiasm and courage, in =
generous=20
      devotion to God and neighbor. In a word, you must set yourselves =
on the=20
      path of holiness. Only thus can you be a sign of God in the world =
and=20
      re-live in your own countries the missionary epic of the early =
Church. You=20
      will also be a leaven of missionary spirit for the older =
churches.</P>
      <P>For their part, missionaries should reflect on the duty of =
holiness=20
      required of them by the gift of their vocation, renew themselves =
in spirit=20
      day by day, and strive to update their doctrinal and pastoral =
formation.=20
      The missionary must be a "contemplative in action." He finds =
answers to=20
      problems in the light of God's word and in personal and community =
prayer.=20
      My contact with representatives of the non-Christian spiritual =
traditions,=20
      particularly those of Asia, has confirmed me in the view that the =
future=20
      of mission depends to a great extent on contemplation. Unless the=20
      missionary is a contemplative he cannot proclaim Christ in a =
credible way.=20
      He is a witness to the experience of God, and must be able to say =
with the=20
      apostles: "that which we have looked upon...concerning the word of =

      life,...we proclaim also to you" (1 Jn 1:1-3).</P>
      <P>The missionary is a person of the Beatitudes. Before sending =
out the=20
      Twelve to evangelize, Jesus, in his "missionary discourse" (cf. Mt =
10),=20
      teaches them the paths of mission: poverty, meekness, acceptance =
of=20
      suffering and persecution, the desire for justice and peace, =
charity - in=20
      other words, the Beatitudes, lived out in the apostolic life (cf. =
Mt=20
      5:1-12). By living the Beatitudes, the missionary experiences and =
shows=20
      concretely that the kingdom of God has already come, and that he =
has=20
      accepted it. The characteristic of every authentic missionary life =
is the=20
      inner joy that comes from faith. In a world tormented and =
oppressed by so=20
      many problems, a world tempted to pessimism, the one who proclaims =
the=20
      "Good News" must be a person who has found true hope in =
Christ.</P>

      <P>92. Today, as never before, the Church has the opportunity of =
bringing=20
      the Gospel, by witness and word, to all people and nations. I see =
the=20
      dawning of a new missionary age, which will become a radiant day =
bearing=20
      an abundant harvest, if all Christians, and missionaries and young =

      churches in particular, respond with generosity and holiness to =
the calls=20
      and challenges of our time.</P>
      <P>Like the apostles after Christ's Ascension, the Church must =
gather in=20
      the Upper Room "together with Mary, the Mother of Jesus" (Acts =
1:14), in=20
      order to pray for the Spirit and to gain strength and courage to =
carry out=20
      the missionary mandate. We too, like the apostles, need to be =
transformed=20
      and guided by the Spirit.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the third millennium the whole Church is invited =
to live=20
      more intensely the mystery of Christ by gratefully cooperating in =
the work=20
      of salvation. The Church does this together with Mary and =
following the=20
      example of Mary, the Church's Mother and model: Mary is the model =
of that=20
      maternal love which should inspire all who cooperate in the =
Church's=20
      apostolic mission for the rebirth of humanity. Therefore, =
"strengthened by=20
      the presence of Christ, the Church journeys through time toward =
the=20
